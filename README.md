# Octadoc
Software for rapid test Database development, for web, game, and application development.

The point of Octadoc is to facility team based Database management.  You will be able to test different input styles.
JS programmers can focus on frontend dev, python devs backend, and database managers can work on getting indexing and 
such correct.  Really the idea is that you can have multiple formats of the same database so that people can work
on their various implementation efforts without having to connect their code to non-working or in development code.

When a change is made to the format of the datastructure or table layout.  Changes can be made across all platforms, one
time, without effecting the development progress; aside from the need to restructure their own code if necessary.  Changes 
will then be uniform and hopefully easier to manage.
